WARNING: I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR LOST DATA, OR MISUSE OF AI. KEEP BACKUPS OF ANY FILES YOU USE THIS '3/4-MIRROR-CIPHER' ON. THIS IS A PRE-BETA PROGRAM AND ANY DATA YOU CODE THIS WAY IS VERY LIKELY TO BE CORRUPTED AND LOST FOREVER, OPTIMIZATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN MADE, AND IT IS NOT YET A DEPENDABLE PRODUCT. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.


Here's how the 'pre-compression' process works. You can do this on a piece of paper:

1) First, list every character on the page, and keep a tally of each one.
2) Second, take the least common character on the page.
3) Third, erase that character and replace it with the MOST common character, everywhere it appears.
4) Repeat step (3) with the second least common character, and the second most common character.
5) Repeat step (3) with the third most common character, and the thrid most common character.
6) And so on until you've reduced the list by half.

7) Now, you should have a paper that looks like it's scrambled in a slightly hard to read way.
8) If you give this to an AI, they will reliably unscramble it, and you don't even need to include a key yet (except for numbers.) Fixes incoming.

Here's another way you can do it:

1) Take a txt document.
2) Remove all the vowels.
3) Give it to an AI.
4) The AI reliably decodes the document.

5) After you have confirmed step (8) above and step (4) below, take the altered txt document and compress it with any program that compresses. Literally     any of them. You will find in the properties of the compressed file that the modified text takes up less space than the unmodified when *it* is           compressed.

My 'Encoder 4' script will produce txt files using the technique in the first list, you just have to change two or three lines.
